<big><sup>A</sup></big> Shepherd boy in a village used to take his herd of sheep across the fields near the forest. He felt this job
was very dull and wanted to have some fun.
</p>

<p align=justify><font color=#4B6B03>
<sup>One day</sup> while grazing the sheep, he shouted, <big><sub><font color=#F3F6F3>"Wolf! Wolf!</font></sub></big> The wolf is carrying away a lamb!" 
Farmers working in the nearby fields came ruuning for help but didn't find any wolf.
</p></font>

<p align=justify>
<i><small>The boy laughed and relied</small></i>,"It was just fun. There is no wolf here."<small>The boy played a similar 
trick repeatedly for many days.</small>
</p>

<p align=justify><font color=4B6B03>
After some days, while the shepherd boy was in the field with the herd of sheep, <sup>suddenly</sup>, a wolf 
came out from the nearby forest and attacked one of the lambs. The boy was frightened and cried
loudly, <i><font color=#F3F6F3>"Wolf! Wolf!</font></i> The wolf is carrying a lamb away!"
</font></p>

<p>
<u>The farmers thooight the boy was playing mischief again.</u>So, no one paid attention to him and 
didn't come to his help.
